# ES0002: Add missing 'partial' modifier on scribed type

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Id | ES0002 |
| Category | Usage |
| Severity | Error |

## Cause

Source generators cannot modify non-partial types.

## Rule description

Scribe requires the target type to be marked as `partial` to add or implement members.

## How to fix rule violations

Add `partial` to the type declaration of the scribed type.

## When to suppress this rule

Do not suppress this rule. It's a compile-time error and will prevent the build from succeeding.

## Example

### Code with error

```csharp
[Scribe]
class Foo // ES0002
{
    MyEnum Bar { get; set; }
}
```

### Code with fix

```csharp
[Scribe]
partial class Foo // partial modifier added
{
    MyEnum Bar { get; set; }
}
```
