# ES1001: Add missing 'Description' attribute on scribed enum

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Id | ES1001 |
| Category | Usage |
| Severity | Info |

## Cause

Enum member does not have a `Description` attribute.

## Rule description

Scribe provides efficient access to the `Description` attribute metadata, so an enum member without the attribute may be an oversight.

In the absence of a `Description` attribute, the identifier text is used instead.

## How to fix rule violations

Add a `Description` attribute with `description` text to the enum member.

## When to suppress this rule

If given enum member does not require an explicit `Description` attribute to change the scribed text.

## Example

### Code with diagnostic

```csharp
enum MyEnum
{
    [Description("Nul")]
    Zero,
    [Description("Een")]
    One,
    Two, // ES1001
}
```

### Code with fix

```csharp
enum MyEnum
{
    [Description("Nul")]
    Zero,
    [Description("Een")]
    One,
    [Description("Twee")] // Added description
    Two,
}
```
