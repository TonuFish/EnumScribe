# ES1003: Remove redundant 'Scribe' attribute

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Id | ES1003 |
| Category | Redundancy |
| Severity | Warning |

## Cause

Scribed type does not contain targeted enum members.

## Rule description

A type requires at least one enum member for scribe to target. Without any, no code will be generated and the attribute serves no purpose.

By default, only public properties are targeted for scribing. Fields may be included by setting `IncludeFields` to true and members with non-public accessibilities by settings the `AccessModifiers` bit flag.

## How to fix rule violations

Remove the `Scribe` attribute, add enum members, set `IncludeFields` to true or set `AccessModifiers` as appropriate.

## When to suppress this rule

When scaffolding types prior to implementation.

## Example

### Code with diagnostic

```csharp
[Scribe] // ES1003
public partial class Foo
{
    public int Fish { get; set; }
}

[Scribe] // ES1003
public partial class Bar
{
    public MyEnum cake;
}

[Scribe] // ES1003
public partial class Bazz
{
    internal MyEnum Pie { get; set; }
}
```

### Code with fix

```csharp
public partial class Foo // Removed scribe
{
    public int Fish { get; set; }
}

[Scribe(IncludeFields = true)] // Allow fields
public partial class Bar
{
    public MyEnum cake;
}

[Scribe(AccessModifiers = AccessModifier.Internal)] // Allow internals
public partial class Bazz
{
    internal MyEnum Pie { get; set; }
}
```
