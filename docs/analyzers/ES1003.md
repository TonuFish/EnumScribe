# ES1003: Remove redundant 'Scribe' attribute

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Id | ES1003 |
| Category | Redundancy |
| Severity | Info |

## Cause

Scribed type does not contain targeted enum members.

## Rule description

A type requires at least one enum member for scribe to target. Without any, no code will be generated and the attribute serves no purpose.

By default, only properties are targeted for scribing. Fields may be included by setting `IncludeFields` to true.

## How to fix rule violations

Remove the `Scribe` attribute, add enum members or set `IncludeFields` to true with enum fields present.

## When to suppress this rule

When scaffolding types prior to implementation.

## Example

### Code with diagnostic

```csharp
[Scribe]
partial class Foo // ES1003
{
    int Fish { get; set; }
}

[Scribe]
partial class Bar // ES1003
{
    MyEnum cake;
}
```

### Code with fix

```csharp
partial class Foo // Removed scribe
{
    int Fish { get; set; }
}

[Scribe(IncludeFields = true)] // Opt into scribing fields
partial class Bar
{
    MyEnum cake;
}
```
