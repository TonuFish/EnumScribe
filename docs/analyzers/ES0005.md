# ES0005: Fix scribed member partial method collision

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Id | ES0005 |
| Category | Usage |
| Severity | Error |

## Cause

Scribe partial method implementation has been disabled.

## Rule description

The requested scribe identifier matches an existing valid partial method, but cannot be implemented as `ImplementPartialMethods` has been explicitly set to false.

## How to fix rule violations

Don't set `ImplementPartialMethods` to false.

## When to suppress this rule

Do not suppress this rule. It's a compile-time error and will prevent the build from succeeding.

## Example

### Code with error

```csharp
[Scribe("Bazz", ImplementPartialMethods = false)]
partial class Foo
{
    MyEnum Bar { get; set; } // ES0005
    partial string BarBazz();
}
```

### Code with fix

```csharp
[Scribe("Bazz")] // ImplementPartialMethods defaults to true
partial class Foo
{
    MyEnum Bar { get; set; }
    partial string BarBazz();
}
```
