# ES1004: Remove redundant no scribe attribute on member of non-scribed type

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Id | ES1004 |
| Category | Redundancy |
| Severity | Warning |

## Cause

No-Scribed member is contained in a non-scribed type.

## Rule description

EnumScribe only considers types annotated with `Scribe`. Marking members of non-scribed types with `NoScribe` serves no purpose.

## How to fix rule violations

Remove the `NoScribe` attribute or mark the containing type with the `Scribe` attribute.

## When to suppress this rule

When scaffolding types prior to implementation.

## Example

### Code with diagnostic

```csharp
public partial class Foo
{
    [NoScribe] // ES1004
    public MyEnum Fish { get; set; }
}

public partial class Bar
{
    [NoScribe] // ES1004
    public MyEnum Cake { get; set; }
}
```

### Code with fix

```csharp
public partial class Foo
{
    public MyEnum Fish { get; set; } // Removed NoScribe
}

[Scribe] // Added Scribe
public partial class Bar
{
    [NoScribe]
    public MyEnum Cake { get; set; }
}
```
