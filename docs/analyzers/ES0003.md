# ES0003: Add missing 'partial' modifier on type enclosing scribed type

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Id | ES0003 |
| Category | Usage |
| Severity | Error |

## Cause

Source generators cannot modify non-partial types.

## Rule description

Scribe requires the target type to be modifiable by a source generator. This implicitly requires the `partial` modifier on all enclosing types.

## How to fix rule violations

Add `partial` to the type declaration to all enclosing types of the scribed type.

## When to suppress this rule

Do not suppress this rule. It's a compile-time error and will prevent the build from succeeding.

## Example

### Code with error

```csharp
class Foo
{
    [Scribe]
    partial class NestedFoo // ES0003
    {
        MyEnum Bar { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Code with fix

```csharp
partial class Foo // partial modifier added
{
    [Scribe]
    partial class NestedFoo
    {
        MyEnum Bar { get; set; }
    }
}
```
