# ES1005: Remove redundant 'NoScribe' attribute on non-enum member

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Id | ES1005 |
| Category | Redundancy |
| Severity | Warning |

## Cause

No-Scribed member is not an enum.

## Rule description

A member will only be considered by EnumScribe if it's an enum. Marking non-enum members with `NoScribe` serves no purpose.

## How to fix rule violations

Remove the `NoScribe` attribute.

## When to suppress this rule

When scaffolding types prior to implementation.

## Example

### Code with diagnostic

```csharp
[Scribe]
public partial class Foo
{
    [NoScribe] // ES1005
    public int Fish { get; set; }
}

[Scribe]
public partial class Bar
{
    [NoScribe] // ES1005
    public string cake;
}
```

### Code with fix

```csharp
[Scribe]
public partial class Foo
{
    public int Fish { get; set; } // Removed NoScribe
}

[Scribe]
public partial class Bar
{
    public string cake; // Removed NoScribe
}
```
